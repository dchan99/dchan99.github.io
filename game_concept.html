    <h1>Game Inspirations</h1>
    <p>My game concept is from multiple concepts. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Top down RPGs like Pokemon
            <img src='http://www.fraghero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/maxresdefault-2-1.jpg'/>
        </li>
        <li>
            Field of view in FPS games

        </li>
        <li>
            Freedom of choice to determine the gameplay. Good vs Evil like the karma system in Infamous

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1> Playthrough </h1>
    <p> This game will be a top down view with field of view implemented. You move your character around with the keyboard and activate your weapon with your mouse. When you come into an enemies field of view, they become "alert" and actively target you. The goal is to navigate the maze like level and reach the end. Players are scored based on how many deaths, how many enemies dead, how many enemies avoided, etc. Players can choose to play steathily or obliterate everything on sight.</p>

    <h1> Health </h1>
    <p> Player and enemies are one-hit-kill except for bosses. Enemies can kill you through their weapons or through touch. </p>

    <h1> Map </h1>
    <p> The map will most likely be predrawn instead of generated automatically. Unless I can work out a logic for generating the map as well as placement of enemies or loot, each level will be manually drawn and plotted </p>

    <h1> Weapons </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Special Pistol
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Only one bullet
                </li>
                <li>
                    After firing, player can control the movement of the bullet with arrow keys or WASD
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gun becomes useless unless player retrieves the bullet
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Railgun
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Long reload time
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b> LOUD </b> which means enemies can hear it and gather
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shoots through two walls and multiple enemies
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            TBD Portal Gun???
            <ul>
                <li>
                </li>
                <li>
                </li>
                <li>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1> Afterthought </h1>
    <p> This is definitely a lot of elements to incorporate and I'm positve I will not be able to do everything I have imagined. To start, I need to learn animation or transitions of objects on the screen. Then I need to design a level with enough complexity to incorporate the different elements. I forsee this being pretty technical and "mathy" when it comes to calculating the field of view on every frame and adjusting the drawn world to grey/black out everything not within the field of view. Afterwards will come interactions with other objects such as enemies and walls. Next comes the use of weapons which will follow a similar logic as to how enemies/walls interacts with the player. Finally, I need to think of giving the enemies autonamy to a certain extent that allows them to move around out of the field of view and each have their own field of view. This is definitely an extremely ambitious projects to accomplish in a 2(???) Weeks.
