    <h1>GitHub Jobs API</h1>
    <p>I want to get data from the GitHub Jobs API and visualize it in some way. Users will be able to type in a keyboard. Then with the data I receieve, I could create some sort of chart, probably a bar graph, that displays the number of jobs by city. I originally planned to create a chart of number of jobs by position of job but each company could rename the job title slightly differently and I don't think it would be possible to combine all relevant job positions. I could also plot the data points onto a map of the United States with circles over the city that represent how many jobs are in that city.</p>
    <p> Example API call: https://jobs.github.com/positions.json?search=python&page=0 <a href="https://jobs.github.com/api"> Documentation </a> </p>
    <p> I may try to incorporate more API calls because the GitHub Jobs API does not have a huge amount of information.

    <h1> Random Cat/Dog Images API </h1>
    <p> Another idea I had was to use one of the many random cat/dog/animal api and visualize the color composition of the photo. In a 500,500 canvas, there will be 250000 pixels to go through which is plenty of data. </p>
