    <h1> Description </h1>
    <img src='/img/finalProjectSketch.png'>
    <p> My final project will be a unique game. The game consists of the player dodging bullets that bounce around the map. The bullet is shot out by the enemy and travels at a certain speed. As the game progresses, there will be more enemies, shorter intervals between bullet fires, as well as increased bullet speed. The player will only hold one bullet that needs to be retrieved after it is fired. Whenever a bullet collides with another bullet, it will deflect each other. Whenever a bullet hits a wall, it will bounce and make the wall momentarily ripple. These actions will be paired with different sound effects like an actual bullet colliding with a piece of steel. As of now, I plan on working in p5.js because it’s fresher on my mind and I would be more comfortable with it. Perhaps I may switch to Processing if it ends up being more efficient. </p>

    <h1> Inspiration: Sinuous</h1>
    <img src='/img/sinuous.png'>
    <p> In Sinuous, the player is a dot with a tail. The goal is to avoid the red moving dots for as long as possible. Along the way, there can be powerups that do different things. As the level increases, the speed of the moving red dots also increases.</p>

    <h1> Inspiration: Modern Space Invaders </h1>
    <img src='/img/bulletHell.png'>
    <p> These types of games usually consist of a swarm of enemies that fires a lot of bullets in all directions. The player only needs to focus on dodging the bullets because the player’s bullets are automatically firing.</p>

    <h1> Technical </h1>
    <p> For this final project, I have a decent understanding of the basic idea of each component. For example, the object’s movements as well as checking to see if the object hit a wall or not. However, this is on a much grander scale where there could potentially be hundreds of objects on the canvas at once. I would need to figure out how to calculate the physics between two objects that are colliding. It requires me to calculate the angles between the two and determine what the resulting movement should look like. Additionally, I need to learn about different ways to detect collision between two moving objects that are not just a single point. I may decide to work with sprites instead of p5 shapes which could make some things easier but other things harder.</p>
    <p> One main problem I could potentially see if the scalability of this game. If there were hundreds of objects on the canvas and I need to check each object with another object, it may become extremely slow and unplayable. </p>

    <h1> Presentation and Beyond </h1>
    <p> For the presentation, I will be connecting my laptop to the external screen or projector. For now, I plan on keeping this as a personal project and post a live working project on my website. </p>

    <h1> Checkpoint: 2018-12-04 </h1>
    <p> By 2018-12-04, I plan on having the physics figured out between two bullets and well as between the bullet and a wall. I will be able to have bullets bounce off walls and off each other as well as make the appropriate sounds for them. </p>

    <h1> Checkpoint: 2018-12-06 </h1>
    <p> By 2018-12-06, I plan to have the player’s character created and be able to be moved around by the user. Additionally, enemies will be randomly generated and choose what direction to fire a newly generated bullet.</p>
