    <h1>Circlar Chart Displaying College Majors and 75th Percentile Salary</h1>
    <p>For this assignment, I wanted to visualize a lot of data. I knew about fivethirtyeight from the previous presidential election where they did a live visualization of the votes as the polls closed. From the data sets, I found a set of data related to college majors. https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors. The most interesting data points I took from that set of data was the number of students in each major and how much 75% of that major's students are making. I did not have any specific influences for this project and developed the idea as I went along. I made the circles overlap one another where the size corresponds to the number of students in the major. With over 150 majors, some circles were right on top of each other so I could not display the name of the majors within the circles. The colors of the circles were determined by the salary, black being the lowest salary, and cyan being the highest salary. After the visualization was done, one major, Patroleum Engineering, was completely cyan with no other majors coming close. That's because the salary for that major nearly doubles the next highest salary and skewed the colors towards the darker end of the given spectrum.</p>

    <h1> Interesting Visualization </h1>
    <p> https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/21/magazine/voyages-travel-sounds-from-the-world.html </p>
    <p> New York Times as well as other publications seem to be moving towards a data visualization focus with New York Times consistently putting out quality content. In this interactive, the user is brought on a journey to experience the sounds in different places around the world. There is a scrolling visual element as well as an auditory element. It is also not a typical sort of visualization that is just displays data in an visually unique sort of way.
