    <h1>P5 - Movement in Squares (1961) Bridget Riley</h1>
    <p>The art piece I choose to try and recreate in P5 was Movements in Square (1961) by Bridget Riley. This art piece contains multiple rows and columns with alternating black and white tiles like a chess board. However, in each row, the tiles get thinner and thinner until a certain point and then starts to widen again.</p>
    <img src='/img/movementInSquares1961reference.jpg'>
    <p>Here is my final recreation in P5. I used two loops that would be used to draw the all the tiles in the row and all the columns. The hard part about this recreation was trying to figure out what kind of mathematical formula would allow me to recreate the rectangles with varying widths. I tried to make the difference of widths the same and drew 16 rectangles to the left of the dividing line. However, the results differed slightly from the original art piece. That also means the rectangles to the right of the dividing line are different too. However, the general idea is there and at first glance, it almost looks the same.</p>
