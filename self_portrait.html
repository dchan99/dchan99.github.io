    <h1>Self-Portrait</h1>
    <p>My main inspiration for this was low-poly models and how similar it was to cubism</p>

    <p>So I began my design with a portrait photo of me. Using Photoshop, I drew in triangle to followed the shape of my face as well as the features such as nose and mouth.</p>

    <p>Afterwards, the rough mockup was loaded into Adobe Illustrator where the pen tool was used to create straight lines and paths in the shape of triangles.</p>

    <p>The final mesh was overlayed ontop of the original photo and scaled so the lines matched my face contours as best as possible. Each triangle was colored by taking a sample of the color on the original photograph.</p>

    <p>Finally, each coordinate was slowly taken from Illustrator and plotted in Processing. Then the colors where taken from Photoshop and used to determine the fill color as well as stroke color.</p>

    <p>This project was much too time consuming. I am somewhat satisfied with the results but not completely convinced it as a worthy trade to the amount of time I invested. However, I did not have any other idea in mind for this project so I had to stick with it. Perhaps in the future, I may revisit this low-poly portrait design and include many more smaller triangles to add additional details.</p>
